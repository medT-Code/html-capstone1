    <h2>Professional summary</h2>
    Web developer with only one month of experience as of now, im still learning under app brewery. I hope to be really goog in the near future thats why i put a lot of work into learning to code. <br>
    I learnt something very outstandig from Jim Rohn which says "i'll take care of me for you, if you take care of you for me" <br>
    those words changed my understanding between self sacrifice and self development. Ever since I've taken my personal development very seriously.
